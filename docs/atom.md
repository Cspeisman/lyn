# Configuring Atom for Lyn development
## Recommended packages
I'd recommend to take a look at [atom-elixir](https://github.com/msaraiva/atom-elixir), but it's not published in apm yet.

Otherwise you can use pretty standard set of packages for elixir development:
```
apm install language-elixir
apm install autocomplete-elixir
apm install linter
apm install linter-elixirc
```
